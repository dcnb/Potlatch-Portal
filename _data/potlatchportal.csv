Many and dire were the predications of what would happen when the girls went to work in the camps, but aside from a sizeable number of school teacher lumberjack marriages and a noticeable sprucing up by all the men in the camps, nothing much happened. The girl flunkeys have worked efficiently and well. A tendency to move about and to not stay in any one camp for more than a few months sometimes weeks, is evident among them. The beckoning finger of other jobs provides a well nigh [sic] irrestible lure with a resulting high turnover of flunkey labor, but, nevertheless they have performed a fine war job.'

The falling tree may twist a little to one side or the other as it falls, or hit another tree and roll sharply to one side, and the butt of the tree may swing in either direction with sufficient force to kill a man if it hits him. For quick escape from the pit saw gangs generally notch steps in the side of the pit. in the picture below sawyers Lang and Jones are shown still in the pit after the tree topples over. it fell a bit quicker than was expected with the result that the men were unable to escape from the pit. the snow on Jones coat was caused by his attempt to hastily scramble out of the pit. He didn't make it, in fact was sprawled half-out and half-in the pit when the tree came to rest. Lang is bent over brushing snow from his clothing in the bottom of the pit.
